After docker is installed and started:
    Create Docker Network for containers to run
        docker network create --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 someNet

    Create the images for the containers:
        docker build -t python_server .  //run this in the folder containing the server files
        docker build -t python_client .  //run this in folder containing the client files

    Run images to create containers (Start with server):
        //these can be run from anywhere
        docker run --net someNet --ip 172.18.0.2 -i python_server
        
        //this container needs its own ip address for server to respond to
        docker run --net someNet --ip 172.18.0.3 -i python_client
